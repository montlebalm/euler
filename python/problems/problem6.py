Question:
	The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
	The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
	Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
	Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

Answer:
	25164150
